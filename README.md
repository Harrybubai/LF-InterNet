## Requirement
* **PyTorch 1.3.0, torchvision 0.4.1. The code is tested with python=3.7, cuda=9.0.**
* **Matlab (For training/test data generation and performance evaluation)**

## Train
Training codes will be released soon.

## Test
* **Download the test sets and unzip them to `./data`. Here, we provide a demo test set (<a href="https://wyqdatabase.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/data_demo.zip">data_demo.zip</a>) which only includes one test scene, and we also provide the full test set (<a href="https://wyqdatabase.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/data.zip">data.zip</a>) which is used in our paper.** 
* **Download our pretrained models (<a href="https://wyqdatabase.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/log.zip">log.zip</a>) and unzip them to `./log`.**
* **Run `GenerateDataForTest.m` to generate test data.**
* **Run `test.py` to perform a demo inference. Note that, the selected pretrained model should match the generated input data and the preset network architecture. Initial results (`.mat` files) will be saved to `./results`.**
* **Run `evaluation.m` to calculate PSNR and SSIM scores and transform initial results (`.mat` files) into `.png` images.**
